## Planned Features

* Map numpad to (w, e, r, s, d, f, x, c, v) on keyboard, to support faster
input on laptops without numpad. Do the same for the operators, but on the
right of the keyboard.
* Display past calculations, similar to a shell. Clicking on previous
calculations loads the result of that calculation into the current input.
* Support for scientific functions and non-standard operations (e.g. trigonometry, logarithms, factorials, etc.)
